Lucy Bookstore - Spreading Knowledge
Lucy is a long-standing bookstore (and library). At Lucy, customers can come to read available books as well as rent them to take home. The bookstore issues membership cards to manage book borrowing and returns. Additionally, if a book is not currently available at Lucy, members can pre-order it.

At Lucy, books are categorized by genre, author, as well as the number of reads and reviews by customers, if available. In the future, customers may come to exchange their favorite books, and Lucy can act as an intermediary for book exchanges.

Currently, Lucy only offers physical books, but the founders plan to expand into audiobooks and digital versions (e-books) in the future.

Lucy currently has around 100,000 titles and maintains comprehensive information, including the physical storage locations on shelves in the warehouse. This helps the bookstore managers to search quickly.

Lucy is doing well in business, but its operations are currently manual. The founders aim to digitize Lucy's operations to run more efficiently and serve customers better.

Information Gathered from Interviews/Meetings
Founders / Stakeholders
Lucy's business model mainly revolves around book rentals. There is a high and diverse demand from users, and most of the available books only meet a portion of this demand. We expect the system to facilitate book reservations more effectively.

Bookstore Managers (Librarians)
Current book rental process for users:
Users must first register for a membership card if they don't have one. This card includes a unique identifier, name, and phone number. The fee for the card is equivalent to the maximum book reservation amount.
Each member can reserve a maximum of 5 books, and if they want to reserve more, they must return books they have already borrowed. The maximum loan period is 14 days, with a late fee of 1% per day for exceeding this period.
All book reservations are recorded in a ledger, including the member's ID, book ID, borrowing date, and return date.
Returned books are placed back into the book warehouse to update the quantity. The warehouse is also managed and divided into compartments, each with a unique identifier code and capable of holding multiple books, distinguished by compartments.
Cases when books are not available at Lucy:
If a book is already borrowed by another member, it will be recorded, and the member will be notified via text when the book is returned.
If a book is not in stock at the store, the details including book title, author, and year of publication will be recorded. Members will be notified when the book is restocked.
If multiple people reserve the same book, reservations are handled on a first-come, first-served basis.

Members
We love the books at Lucy because they come with attached reviews from other members, which is very special to us. Additionally, Lucy's librarians are knowledgeable and can suggest suitable books.

However, the increasing number of members is causing Lucy to become overwhelmed. We often have to wait a long time for our turn or for books to be returned by other members. Sometimes librarians forget to send notification messages, so we have to go to the bookstore ourselves to find books.

Desires
We want a method to search for books faster than having to manually search through ledgers to find their locations in the warehouse.
With over 100,000 books and more than 20,000 members, the library is handling over 150,000 book rentals and returns each month. At peak times, Lucy can handle over 50,000 rentals and returns, with up to 2000 reservations in a single day. Manual tasks such as searching for books, updating inventory, and sending notifications to members are very time-consuming.
Requirements
Design a system to digitize Lucy's bookstore operations in line with the above requirements.
